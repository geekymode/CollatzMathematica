# CollatzMathematica

An interactive visualization of the Collatz Conjecture (3n+1 problem) created with Mathematica and exported to HTML. This is also a companion Julia package [CollatzConjecture.jl](https://geekymode.github.io/CollatzConjecture.jl/dev/). 

## Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture is one of mathematics' most famous unsolved problems. For any positive integer n:
- If n is even, divide it by 2
- If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
- Repeat until you reach 1

This project provides an interactive mathematical exploration of Collatz sequences and their properties. You can read an exposition on this topic, [Fun with The Collatz conjecture](https://geekymode.github.io/CollatzBlog/).

## About the Collatz Conjecture

Despite its simple rules, the Collatz Conjecture remains unproven. It's conjectured that every positive integer eventually reaches 1, but this hasn't been proven for all numbers.
